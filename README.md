### Literature Background 📑
- Grit is defined as perseverance and passion towards reaching a long-term goal (Duckworth et al., 2007).
- Grit has been found to be a predictor of academic success (Calo et al., 2022), bey
leading to an increase in attention towards the social identity factors that contribute to grit.
- Studies have investigated the social identity factors in middle school students (Ma et al., 2020) and college students (Khoirunnisa et al., 2023).
- **Gap**: However, there has yet to be studies that specifically investigate the social identity factors that contribute to grit in the adolescent age group.

### Present Study 🎯
- The present study seeks to investigate whether adolescents with higher self-control have higher grit and whether gender moderates this relationship.
- **Gap**: Do adolescents who have higher self-control possess higher levels of grit? If so, does gender moderate this relationship?
- This question is meaningful as.......

### Approach 🧩
- Dataset used: Research on Adaptive Interests, Skills, and Environments Study
  - Hoyle, R. H. (2024). Research on Adaptive Interests, Skills, and Environments (RAISE) Study, North Carolina, 2015–2019 (ICPSR 36850; Version 3). Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR36850.v3
- Sample size: N=2104 adolescents in grades 5- 8 in North Carolina public schools during the 2014-2015 school year
- How data is collected in original study: A 90-minute, 247-item survey was administered via telephone to each participant.
How the analytic method and variables used match the question: 

### Findings 🔎
- **Analysis 1:** Correlation between self-control and grit

### Impact 🌎
**Importance:** This research offers a direction in which to devise strategies for both predicting and increasing grit, which consequently leads to higher academic success.

**Benefitting groups:** Parents, educators, high schools, tutors, learning strategiests, standardized testing agencies 

**Applied uses:** 
- Based on the correlation between grit and self-control, schools should focus on tactics that increase self-control to target student levels of grit
- Standardized tests or academic diagnostic mechanisms that try to gauge student success levels can use self-control and an indicator of grit
- The lack of a moderation effect of either gender and race suggest that gender and race-specific interventions are unnecessary
