### Literature Background 📑
- Grit is defined as *perseverance* and *passion* towards reaching a long-term goal 	<sub>(Duckworth et al., 2007)</sub>.
- Grit has been found to be a predictor of academic success, leading to an increase in attentino towards the social identity factors that contribute to grit <sub>(Calo et al., 2022)</sub>
- Studies have investigated the social identity factors in middle school students <sub>(Ma et al., 2020)</sub> and college students (<sub>Khoirunnisa et al., 2023)</sub>.
- **Gap**: However, there has yet to be studies that specifically investigate the social identity factors that contribute to grit in the adolescent age group.

### Present Study 🎯
- The present study seeks to investigate whether self-control as a social identity factor is associated with grit. It also explores two potential moderators of this relationship, gender and race.
- **Gap**: Do adolescents who have higher self-control possess higher levels of grit? If so, does gender and race moderate this relationship?
- This question is meaningful as adolescents are in a critical period of academic development which determines the trajectory of their future professional careers. This prompts an urgency to investigate the factors that increase grit.

### Approach 🛣️
- Dataset used: Research on Adaptive Interests, Skills, and Environments Study
  - Hoyle, R. H. (2024). Research on Adaptive Interests, Skills, and Environments (RAISE) Study, North Carolina, 2015–2019 (ICPSR 36850; Version 3). Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR36850.v3
- Sample size: N=2104 adolescents in grades 5- 8 in North Carolina public schools during the 2014-2015 school year
- How data is collected in original study: A 90-minute, 247-item survey was administered via telephone to each participant.
How the analytic method and variables used match the question: 

### Findings 🔎
**Analysis 1:** Correlation between self-control and grit
- <ins>Purpose:</ins> To determine whether there is a relationship between self-control and grit
- <ins>Finding:</ins> There is statistically significant correlation (p<0.05) between self-control and grit. The direction and strength of this correlation are positive and weak (r=0.37)
- <ins>Digestible interpretation:</ins> The higher an individual’s level of self-control, the more likely they are to have high levels of grit

**Analysis 2:** Moderation analysis of gender (male vs. female)
- <ins>Purpose:</ins> To determine whether gender moderates the relationship between self-control and grit
- <ins>Finding:</ins> There is no statistically significant moderation effect of gender
- <ins>Digestible interpretation:</ins> The relationship between grit and self-control does not differ when the sample is grouped by gender

**Analysis 3:** Moderation analysis of race (white vs. non-white)
- <ins>Purpose:</ins> To determien whether race moderates the relationship between self-control and grit
- <ins>Finding:</ins> There is no statistically significant moderation effect of race
- <ins>Digestible interpretation:</ins> The relationship between grit and self-control does not differ when the sample is grouped by gender

### Impact 🌎
- **Importance:** This research offers a direction in which to devise strategies for both predicting and increasing grit, which consequently leads to higher academic success.
- **Benefitting groups:** Parents, educators, high schools, tutors, learning strategiests, standardized testing agencies 
- **Applied uses:** 
  - Based on Finding 1, the correlation between grit and self-control:
    - Schools should focus on tactics that increase self-control to target student levels of grit
    - Standardized tests or academic diagnostic mechanisms that try to gauge student success levels can use self-control and an indicator of grit
  - Based on Findings 2 and 3, the lack of a moderation effects of gender and race:
    - Gender and race-specific interventions to increase levels of grit are unnecessary
