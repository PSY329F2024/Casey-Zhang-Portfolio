## About me üìñ
Hi everyone! I‚Äôm Casey, a fourth-year student in the psychology research specialist program at the University of Toronto. I'm interested in the interesctions between moral psychology and the law, and hope to one day conduct research on the psychology of criminal justice procedure.

### Literature Background üìë
- Grit is defined as perseverance and passion towards reaching a long-term goal 	<sub>(Duckworth et al., 2007)</sub>.
- The character trait has been found to be a predictor of academic success, leading to an increase in attention towards the social identity factors that contribute to grit <sub>(Calo et al., 2022)</sub>.
- Studies have investigated the social identity determinants of grit in middle school students <sub>(Ma et al., 2020)</sub> and college students <sub>(Khoirunnisa et al., 2023)</sub>.
- <ins>Gap:</ins> However, there has yet to be studies that specifically investigate the social identity factors that contribute to grit in the adolescent age group.

### Present Study üéØ
- The present study has two aims. First, it seeks to investigate whether self-control as a social identity factor is associated with grit. Second, it explores two potential moderators of this relationship, gender and race. In other words, it looks at whether the connection depends on the person's gender and race.
- <ins>Research Question:</ins> Do adolescents who have higher self-control possess higher levels of grit? If so, do gender and race moderate this relationship?
  - This question is meaningful as adolescents are in a critical period of academic development, prompting an urgency to investigate the social identity factors that increase grit in this age specific group.

### Approach üõ£Ô∏è
<ins>Dataset used:</ins> Research on Adaptive Interests, Skills, and Environments (RAISE) Study <sub>(Hoyle, 2024)</sub>
  - Hyperlink: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36850/summary
- <ins>Sample</ins>
  - Size: N=2104
  - Composition: Adolescents in grades 5- 8 in North Carolina public schools during the 2014-2015 school year
- <ins>Method of data collection:</ins> A 90-minute, 247-item survey containing various demographic measures and scales were administered via telephone to each participant.

<ins>Measurements of interest & How they Match the Research Question:</ins>
- Self-control: Total Self-control Scale <sub>(Hoyle & Davission, 2016)</sub>
  - Measures self-control in the research question's search for a relationship between self-control and grit

- Grit: Grit scale <sub>(Duckworth & Quinn, 2009)</sub>
  - Measures grit in the research question's search for a relationship between self-control and grit

- Demographic Variables:
  - Gender: 47.9% male, 52.1% female
  - Race: 60.8% White, 26.6% Black, 6.2% American Indian/Alaska Native, 4.1% Asian, 1% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
  - Gender and race questions measure the gender and race categorization in the research question

<ins>Analytic Methods & How they Match the Research Question:</ins>
- <ins>Analysis 1:</ins> Correlation between self-control and grit
  - Purpose: To determine whether there is a relationship between self-control and grit
- <ins>Analysis 2:</ins> Moderation analysis of gender (male vs. female)
  - Purpose: To determine whether gender moderates the relationship between self-control and grit
- <ins>Analysis 3:</ins> Moderation analysis of race (white vs. non-white)
  - Purpose: To determien whether race moderates the relationship between self-control and grit

- How the analytic method and variables used match the question:
- Correlation: Correlation between self-control and grit

### Findings üîé
**Analytic codes:**
- RMD File: https://github.com/Caseyzhang1/PSY329-Project/blob/main/Psy329_Project.Rmd
- MD File: https://github.com/Caseyzhang1/PSY329-Project/blob/main/Psy329_Project.md 

**Analysis 1:** Correlation between self-control and grit
- <ins>Finding:</ins> There is statistically significant correlation (p<0.05) between self-control and grit. The direction and strength of this correlation are positive and weak (r=0.37)
- <ins>Digestible interpretation:</ins> The higher an individual‚Äôs level of self-control, the more likely they are to have high levels of grit

**Analysis 2:** Moderation analysis of gender (male vs. female)
- <ins>Finding:</ins> There is no statistically significant moderation effect of gender
- <ins>Digestible interpretation:</ins> The relationship between grit and self-control does not differ when the sample is grouped by gender
![g2](/img/g2.png)

**Analysis 3:** Moderation analysis of race (white vs. non-white)
- <ins>Finding:</ins> There is no statistically significant moderation effect of race
- <ins>Digestible interpretation:</ins> The relationship between grit and self-control does not differ when the sample is grouped by gender

### Impact üåé
- **Importance:** This research offers a direction in which to devise strategies for both predicting and increasing grit, which consequently leads to higher academic success.
- **Benefitting groups:** Parents, educators, high schools, tutors, learning strategiests, standardized testing agencies 
- **Applied uses:** 
  - Based on Finding 1, the correlation between grit and self-control:
    - Schools should focus on tactics that increase self-control to target student levels of grit
    - Standardized tests or academic diagnostic mechanisms that try to gauge student success levels can use self-control and an indicator of grit
  - Based on Findings 2 and 3, the lack of a moderation effects of gender and race:
    - Gender and race-specific interventions to increase levels of grit are unnecessary
